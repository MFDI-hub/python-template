## Publishing Releases

This is how to publish a Python package to [**PyPI**](https://pypi.org/) from GitHub
Actions, when using the
[**python-template**](https://github.com/MFDI-hub/python-template) template.

Thanks to
[the dynamic versioning plugin](https://github.com/ninoseki/uv-dynamic-versioning/),
the [`release.yml`](https://github.com/MFDI-hub/python-template/blob/main/template/.github/workflows/release.yml)
workflow (semantic-release), and the [`publish.yml`](https://github.com/MFDI-hub/python-template/blob/main/template/.github/workflows/publish.yml)
workflow, tagged GitHub Releases publish the matching version to PyPI.

You can release in either way:

1. **Automatic (recommended):** push Conventional Commits to `main`/`master`. The
   semantic-release workflow creates a GitHub Release + `vX.Y.Z` tag when commits warrant
   a bump. That release triggers `publish.yml`.
2. **Manual:** create a tagged release yourself in the GitHub UI or with `gh` (below).

### First-Time Setup

This part is a little confusing the first time.
Here is the simplest way to do it.
For the purposes of this example replace OWNER and PROJECT with the right values.

**Note:** These steps assume you already have a GitHub repo with your code pushed. If
you're setting up manually, create an **empty** GitHub repo (no
README, no .gitignore, no license — the template already provides these) and push your
code to it. See the
[python-template README](https://github.com/MFDI-hub/python-template)
for Copier usage and repo layout.

1. **Get a PyPI account** at [pypi.org](https://pypi.org/) and sign in.

2. **Pick a name for the project** that isn’t already taken.

   - Go to `https://pypi.org/project/PROJECT` to see if another project with that name
     already exits.

   - If needed, update your `pyproject.toml` with the correct name.

3. **Authorize** your repository to publish to PyPI:

   - Go to [the publishing settings page](https://pypi.org/manage/account/publishing/).

   - Find “Trusted Publisher Management” and register your GitHub repo as a new
     “pending” trusted publisher.

   - Enter the project name, repo owner, repo name, and `publish.yml` as the workflow
     name. (You can leave the “environment name” field blank.)

4. **Create a first release** so versioning starts on `0.x` (optional but recommended):

   semantic-release’s first release is `1.0.0` if no tags exist. To stay on `0.x`, create
   an initial tag once after setup:

   ```shell
   git tag v0.1.0
   git push origin v0.1.0
   gh release create v0.1.0 --generate-notes
   ```

   Later bumps follow Conventional Commits automatically.

5. **Confirm it publishes to PyPI**

   - Watch for the release workflow in the GitHub Actions tab.

   - If it succeeds, you should see it appear at `https://pypi.org/project/PROJECT`.

### Publishing Subsequent Releases

Follow this checklist for each new release.

#### Pre-Release Checklist

1. **Verify all changes are committed and pushed:**

   ```shell
   git status
   git log origin/main..HEAD  # should be empty if pushed
   ```

2. **Run linting and tests locally:**

   ```shell
   make lint
   make test
   ```

3. **Confirm CI is passing:**

   ```shell
   gh run list --limit 3
   ```

   Or check the Actions tab on GitHub.

4. **Determine the new version number** (manual releases only):

   ```shell
   # Check current/latest version:
   gh release list --limit 1
   ```

   Use [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/) / Conventional Commits:

   - **fix:** → patch (e.g. `v0.5.8` → `v0.5.9`)
   - **feat:** → minor (e.g. `v0.5.9` → `v0.6.0`)
   - **BREAKING CHANGE** / `!` → major (e.g. `v0.6.0` → `v1.0.0`)

#### Create the Release

5. **Automatic:** merge Conventional Commits to `main` and let `release.yml` create the
   GitHub Release.

6. **Manual — create the release with `gh`:**

   ```shell
   NEW_TAG="vX.Y.Z"  # Replace with actual version
   LAST_TAG=$(gh release list --limit 1 --json tagName -q '.[0].tagName')
   
   gh release create "${NEW_TAG}" \
     --title "${NEW_TAG}" \
     --notes "$(cat <<'EOF'
   ## What's Changed
   
   [Summarize changes here--see format guide below]
   
   ### Full Changelog
   
   https://github.com/OWNER/PROJECT/compare/${LAST_TAG}...${NEW_TAG}
   EOF
   )"
   ```

   Alternatively, use `--generate-notes` for GitHub’s auto-generated notes, or
   `--notes-file FILENAME` to read from a file.

7. **Verify the release published successfully:**

   ```shell
   # Check the release workflow:
   gh run list --workflow=publish.yml --limit 1
   
   # Verify on PyPI (may take a minute):
   # https://pypi.org/project/PROJECT
   ```

### Release Notes Format

Use this structure for release notes (manual releases):

```markdown
## What's Changed

### Bug Fixes

**Short title of fix**

Description of what was fixed and why it matters.

### New Features

**Short title of feature**

Description of the new capability.

### Breaking Changes

**Short title of breaking change**

Description of what changed and how to migrate.

### Full Changelog

https://github.com/OWNER/PROJECT/compare/vPREVIOUS...vNEW
```

Guidelines:

- Use `## What's Changed` as the top-level heading.

- Group changes under `### Bug Fixes`, `### New Features`, `### Breaking Changes`, etc.
  as appropriate.

- Use `**bold**` for short titles of individual changes.

- Include technical details only when helpful for users.

- Always include the Full Changelog compare link at the end.

- For small releases, a simple bullet list is acceptable instead of full sections.
